# Tailwind CSS VS Code Configuration

To fix the CSS validation errors for Tailwind directives like `@tailwind` and `@apply`, we've added:

1. A configuration in `.vscode/settings.json` that tells VS Code about Tailwind CSS directives
2. A custom data file at `.vscode/tailwind-css-data.json` that defines these directives

## Important: Reload VS Code

**You need to reload VS Code for these changes to take effect.**

To reload VS Code:
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
2. Type "Reload Window" and select that option

After reloading, the CSS validation errors for Tailwind directives should be gone.

## What was fixed?

This configuration teaches the VS Code CSS language service about Tailwind CSS custom directives:
- `@tailwind`
- `@apply`
- `@layer`
- `@responsive`
- `@screen`
- `@variants`

These directives are completely valid in your Tailwind CSS workflow, and now VS Code knows about them too!
