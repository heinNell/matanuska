# Component Integration Check Tool

This tool verifies proper integration between routes, navigation, and components in the Matanuska Transport Platform.

## Overview

The Component Integration Check Tool analyzes your codebase to ensure:
- Routes in App.tsx have corresponding components
- Navigation items in Sidebar.tsx link to valid routes
- Routes are properly connected to page components
- There are no duplicate component implementations

## Usage

You can run the tool using one of the following methods:

**Using npm script:**
```bash
npm run check:integration
```

**Using the shell script:**
```bash
./check-integration.sh
```

## What It Checks

The tool performs the following checks:

1. **Route Detection**: Scans App.tsx to find all defined routes
2. **Navigation Items**: Scans Sidebar.tsx to find all navigation links
3. **Component Files**: Scans the pages and components directories
4. **Route-Component Matching**: Verifies that routes have corresponding page components
5. **Duplicate Detection**: Identifies potentially duplicate component implementations
6. **Route Coverage**: Checks for routes that exist in the sidebar but not in App.tsx (and vice versa)

## Report Output

The tool generates a comprehensive report that includes:

1. **Route Count**: Total number of routes in App.tsx and Sidebar
2. **Component Coverage**: Number of routes with matching components
3. **Missing Components**: List of routes that don't have component implementations
4. **Duplicate Components**: Potentially duplicate component implementations
5. **Inconsistent Routes**: Routes that appear in only App.tsx or Sidebar but not both

## Benefits

Using this tool helps:
- Ensure routes are properly connected to components
- Prevent "page not found" errors from missing components
- Identify redundant or duplicate code
- Maintain consistency between your navigation and routing
- Avoid "dead" routes that don't appear in the navigation
