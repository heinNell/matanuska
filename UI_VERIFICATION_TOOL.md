# UI Connection Verification Tool

This tool analyzes React components to verify that UI elements (buttons, forms, modals) are properly connected to their respective handlers.

## Overview

The UI Connection Verification Tool scans your React components and checks that:
- Buttons have corresponding handler functions
- Forms have submission handlers and validation
- Modals/Dialogs have open/close handlers

The tool uses pattern matching to find UI elements and their handlers, then reports any potential issues where UI elements might not be properly connected to event handlers.

## Usage

### Running the Tool

You can run the tool using one of the following methods:

**Using npm script:**
```bash
npm run verify:ui-connections
```

**Using the shell script:**
```bash
./verify-ui-connections.sh
```

### Generated Report

The tool generates a detailed Markdown report at `UI_CONNECTION_REPORT.md` that includes:

1. **Summary:** Overall stats about analyzed components and their connection status
2. **Potential Issues:** A table listing all detected issues
3. **Component Details:** Detailed breakdown of issues per component
4. **Recommendations:** General recommendations for fixing the issues

## How It Works

The tool scans for UI elements by analyzing component files for patterns like:
- Button elements with specific naming conventions (e.g., "editButton", "saveBtn")
- Form elements and form submission functions
- Modal/Dialog components and their open/close functions

Then it checks if there are corresponding handler functions following naming conventions like:
- `handleEdit`, `onEdit` for edit buttons
- `handleSubmit`, `onSubmit` for forms
- `handleModalOpen`, `onDialogClose` for modals

## Customization

If you need to adjust the detection patterns:

1. Open `scripts/verify-ui-connections.cjs`
2. Modify the `UI_PATTERNS` or `HANDLER_PATTERNS` objects
3. Run the tool again to apply your changes

## Benefits

Using this tool helps:
- Identify potentially disconnected UI elements before they cause bugs
- Ensure forms have proper validation
- Maintain consistent handler naming across the codebase
- Improve overall code quality and user experience
