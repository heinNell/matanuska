# Google Maps Integration Fix

This document explains the changes made to fix the "You have included the Google Maps JavaScript API multiple times on this page" error.

## Problem

The error occurs when the Google Maps JavaScript API is loaded more than once on the same page. This can happen when:

1. Multiple components independently try to load the Maps API
2. Different parts of the app request the API with different libraries
3. Third-party libraries also try to load the Maps API

## Solution

We implemented several fixes:

1. **Centralized API Loading**: Enhanced `googleMapsLoader.ts` to prevent duplicate loading by:
   - Checking for existing API instance before loading
   - Tracking and deduplicating library requests
   - Improving promise handling for concurrent load requests

2. **Script Tag Detection**: Added `mapScriptFixer.ts` to automatically:
   - Detect duplicate Google Maps script tags in the DOM
   - Remove extra script tags to prevent API loading conflicts
   - Run checks both on DOMContentLoaded and window load events

3. **Hook Improvement**: Enhanced the `useLoadGoogleMaps` hook to:
   - Check if the API is already loaded before initiating a new load
   - Handle errors more gracefully
   - Better integrate with the centralized loading system

## Implementation

- The script fixer is imported directly in `App.tsx` to ensure it runs early
- Library requests are now tracked across components to prevent duplicate loading
- Multiple checks prevent the "multiple load" warning

## Best Practices

When using Google Maps in the application:

1. Always use the `useLoadGoogleMaps` hook instead of directly loading the API
2. If you need specific libraries, specify them in the hook parameters
3. For non-React code, use the `loadGoogleMapsScript` function

These changes ensure that the Google Maps API is loaded exactly once, regardless of how many components need it, which prevents the warning and potential map functionality issues.
